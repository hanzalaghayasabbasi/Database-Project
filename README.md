# Database-Project <br>
This is my Database lab Project in the University<br>
<b> Features: </b> <br>
1 Strong Password Policy on the Login and SignUp Pages.<br>
Password Policy: Requires a minimum of 10 characters, including at least 2 special characters and 1 number.<br>
2 Storing Three Types of Logs: Failure, Success, and Both.<br>
3 Using Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection Attacks.<br>
4 Using bcrypt with a salt factor of 10 for storing Passwords in the Database.<br>
5 Continuous Monitoring of Login in the Console.<br>

Note: I am using Microsoft Workbench as a database. Integrating it with Express is difficult because I did not find any help on how to configure Express to work with Workbench. ChatGPT helped me a lot in this task.<br>

Below is our Login Portal
